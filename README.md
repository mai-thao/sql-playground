Learning about [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (Structured Query Language)

### Get Started
Before you can start interacting with any of these scripts, you'll need to spin up a PostgreSQL server first (or any other relational database systems, e.g. MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, etc.)

I like to spin up my own server on my local machine using the instructions [here](https://github.com/mai-thao/postgres-playground)!
